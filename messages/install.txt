You have successfully installed the Sublime Streamlit package, a collection of tools that will help you use Python's Streamlit package more efficiently and easily.

Sublime Streamlit provides completion for all Streamlit commands. The full list of completions can be found in the `streamlit.sublime-completions` file.

Sublime Streamlit adds a new build system, `Streamlit`, which uses `streamlit run` to run a Streamlit program.

Sublime Streamlit has two commands for exploring Streamlit docs:
1. In a program, select a Streamlit command (example: `st.write`) and run the `Streamlit: Doc` command in the command palette to open the command's documentation page in the browser.
2. To search for the documentation of a Streamlit command, run the `Streamlit: Search Doc` command in the command palette. Select the desired command to open its documentation page in the browser.

For more information, visit the README.md file via the `Streamlit: Open Readme` command in the command palette.
